      Use this pattern to define the isolated form of a disease when a term exists
      for the isolated/syndromic-neutral version. In general, this pattern should
      be used in parallel with syndromic. E.g. if you make a term ''syndromic disease,
      you should also have ''isolated disease'' [see pattern here(https://github.com/monarch-initiative/mondo/blob/master/src/patterns/dosdp-patterns/syndromic.yaml).  Note
      that the isolated and syndromic forms will be inferred to be disjoint due to

      This pattern is meant to be used for OMIM diseases, including children of OMIM

      Notes about the OMIMPS (see also OMIM_phenotypic_series.yaml):  - every instance
      of the OMIMPS metaclass should be equivalent to (via annotated xref) to something
      in OMIMPS namespace - the OMIMPS will never have an asserted causative gene
      as logical axiom (and no single causative gene in text def) - the OMIMPS must
      never be equivalent to an OMIM:nnnnnn (often redundant with the above rule)
      - the OMIMPS must have an acronym synonym, e.g. HPE - the OMIMPS must have two
      or more subclasses (direct or indirect) that are equivalent to OMIMs and conform
      to this pattern - the subclasses should (not must) have a logical def that uses
      the PS as a genus  - the OMIM subclasses must have acronym synonyms that are
      the parent syn + number, e.g. HPE1, HPE2 - the primary label for the children
      should also be parent + {"type"} + number - the first member will usually have
      the same number local ID as the PS Examples: [holoprosencephaly 1](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0009349),
