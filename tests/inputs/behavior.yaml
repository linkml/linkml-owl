  DrosophilaCourtshipBehavior:
    description: >-
      Drosophila males display a complex repertoire of behaviors that have evolved to achieve reproductive success. 
      This includes following the female, tapping her with his forelegs, 
      contacting her genitalia with his mouthparts, 
      singing a species-specific courtship song, and bending his abdomen to copulate [3]. 
      It is presumed that Drosophila females assess a courting male by ‘summating’ 
      sensory cues for species type and fitness before sanctioning mating [3].
      A virgin female has the ability to be unreceptive to and resist the courtship of 
      a Drosophila male by exhibiting rejection behaviors, which include extruding her ovipositor, 
      kicking, or decamping [3–6]. 
      If she decides to accept the male, she slows down, ceases rejection behaviors and opens her vaginal plate 
      for copulation [3]. After successful copulation, mated females become temporarily sexually unreceptive
      to further copulatory attempts, increasing their rate of egg-laying (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3563961/)
