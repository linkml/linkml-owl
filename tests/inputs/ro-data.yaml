- id: BFO:0000050
  conforms_to: ObjectProperty
  label: part of
  inverse_of:
    id: BFO:0000051
    label: has part
  subproperty_of: RO:0002131 ## overlaps
  definition: a core relation that holds between a part and its whole
  transitive: true

## chains

- id: RO:0002131
  conforms_to: DefinedObjectPropertyByChain
  label: overlaps
  subproperty_of: RO:0002323
  definition: a core relation that holds between a part and its whole
  symmetric: true
  subproperty_of_pairwise_chain:
    - first_member: BFO:0000051

## chains to reflexive, see https://oborel.github.io/obo-relations/reflexivity/

- id: RO:0002314
  conforms_to: DefinedObjectPropertyByChain
  #conforms_to: DefinedObjectPropertyByChainToReflexive ### TODO
  label: characteristic of part of
  definition: A relationship between a characteristic and an entity where the characteristic is of either the entity itself or a part of the entity

## test for transitive form, e.g. develops-from is transitive form of directly-develops-from

- id: RO:0002202
  conforms_to: TransitiveForm
  label: develops from
  definition: >-
    x develops from y if and only if either
    (a) x directly develops from y or
    (b) there exists some z such that x directly develops from z and z develops from y

    id: RO:0002203
    label: develops into
