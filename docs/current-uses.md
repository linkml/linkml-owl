# Current uses of LinkML-OWL

Currently LinkML-OWL is only being rolled out for production projects in very select places.

As a relatively new project compared to other OWL templating projects, there should be a demonstrable
need for some of the features of this framework

## Use in RO

The [Relation Ontology](http://obofoundry.org/ontoogy/ro) (RO) is an ontology of
relations (ObjectProperties). Many relations in RO have a stereotypical form, often
employing complex OWL axioms that need repeating.

 - [RO metamodel](https://oborel.github.io/obo-relations/metamodel/)

The [interaction relations](https://oborel.github.io/obo-relations/metamodel/ObjectPropertyDefinedByInteractionProcess/) in RO
require particularly complex axioms, so this part is autogenerated using LinkML-OWL

## Computational LOINC

The [Computational LOINC](https://github.com/loinc/comp-loinc) project uses LinkML to
represent the underlying structure of LOINC codes, and uses LinkML-OWL to generate OWL
which is reasoned over and classified.

## ChemROF

[ChemROF](https://chemkg.github.io/chemrof/) is a schema / data model for representing chemical elements,
molecules, mixtures, and reactions. ChemROF is also designed to be able to generate
a CHEBI-like ontology directly from source data
