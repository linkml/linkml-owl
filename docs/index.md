# linkml-owl

A framework for translating LinkML instance data to OWL Ontologies (TBoxes and ABoxes)

[LinkML](https://linkml/io/linkml) is a general purpose data modeling
language for authoring schemas to structure data. The perspective of
linkml-owl is that elements of an OWL ontology (in particular,
classes) are data elements that should conform to a schema
